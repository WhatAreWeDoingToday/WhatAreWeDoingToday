# What Are We Doing Today? ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

We created this app for the 2022 Technica Hackathon!

We wanted to create an app to encourage people to leave their house and have fun!
It's easy to forget to take care of ourselves and not prioritize our mental health. 
Take a break and pick from one of our four categories - arts, parks, events, and breweries - and explore your interests!

## :computer:

Created using JavaScript & React.
We used five third-party APIs:
1. NYC Data - Art Galleries
2. recreation.gov
3. nps.gov
4. Open Breweries DB
5. Seat Geek

This site was created using React.

## Future Direction
- Allow users to pick between free or paid events
- Right now this app is only for New Yorkers, in the future we want to expand to include other areas
- Allow users to adjust distance and filter locations
- Include more categories and APIs
