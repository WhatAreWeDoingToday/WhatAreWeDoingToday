# What Are We Doing Today? 🤷🏻‍♀️

We created this app for the 2022 Technica Hackathon! 
💪🏼 This app was created in less than 24 hours! 💪🏼 

According to WHO, the global prevalence of anxiety and depression increased by 25% since the COVID-19 pandemic. 
We wanted to create an app to encourage people to leave their house, explore their interests, and have fun!
Take a break and pick from one of our four categories - arts, parks, events, and breweries - and we will suggest an activity for the user to try!

Feelings of anxiety and depression impact our decision-making ability and motivation so we wanted to keep the UI simple to require minimal decision making. 

We used external APIs to come up with suggestions based on the interests the user selects.
If the user is interested in the activity we suggest, they can find out more information such as the location, price, and description.
If they aren't interested, they can keep shuffling through different suggestions or go back and re-select their interest categories.

## :computer:

This app was created using JavaScript & React.
Due to time constraints, we focused on using third-party APIs and React  instead of building out the backend.
The third-party APIs we used are:
1. NYC Data - Art Galleries
2. Recreation Information Database
3. National Park Service
4. Open Breweries DB
5. Seat Geek

## Future Direction
- Currently, our app is only for New York, in the future we want to expand to include other areas.
- We would like to add more filters to the suggestions (such as by price, location, distance, etc.) to better tailor activity suggestions to users.
- We would like to add more interest categories annd expand the APIs we're working with. Due to the time constraints, some of the APIs we used had inconsistent or outdated data. We would want to incorporate more up-to-date and consistent data for our app.
- We want to add a messaging feature so used can send an acitivty they are interested in to a friend.
