# What Are We Doing Today? 🤷🏻‍♀️

💪🏼 This app was created for the 2022 Technical Hackathon in less than 24 hours! 💪🏼 

During the COVID-19 pandemic, lots of outlets for individuals closed. Self-care became more difficult, as people were not able to leave their homes and see others. This was confounded by the closure of many in-person activities (such as universities, workplaces) that, though we wouldn't think of them as self-care, allowed us to interact with others. [According to WHO](https://www.who.int/news/item/02-03-2022-covid-19-pandemic-triggers-25-increase-in-prevalence-of-anxiety-and-depression-worldwide#:~:text=In%20the%20first%20year%20of,Health%20Organization%20(WHO)%20today.), the global prevalence of anxiety and depression increased by 25% since the COVID-19 pandemic.

We wanted to create an app to encourage people to leave their home, explore their interests, and have fun! Since feeling of anxiety and depression can impact our decision-making ability and motivation, we kept the UI simple.

* **A user can pick from one of our four categories - arts, parks, events, and breweries - based on their current mood, and we will suggest an activity. _Simple as that!_**
  * If the user is interested in the suggested activity, they can find out more information, such as the location, price, and description, by flipping over the "card"
  * If they aren't interested, they can keep shuffling through different suggestions or go back and change their interest categories.

## :computer:

This app was created using JavaScript, React, HTML, & CSS.

Due to time constraints, we focused on using third-party APIs and React, instead of building out the backend.
The third-party APIs used are:
1. NYC Data - Art Galleries
2. Recreation Information Database
3. National Park Service
4. Open Breweries DB
5. Seat Geek

## Future Direction
- Currently, our app is only for New York. In the future, we want to expand it to include other areas.
- Add more filters to the suggestions (such as price, city/state, distance, etc.) to better tailor activity suggestions to users.
- Expand the APIs we're working with and add more interest categories. Due to the time and monetary constraints, some of the APIs used have inconsistent or outdated data. We would want to incorporate more up-to-date and consistent data for our app.
- Incorporate a messaging feature to allow the user to send an activity they are interested in to a friend via text or internal message.
